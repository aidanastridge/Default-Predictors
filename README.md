# Default-Predictors

## About the Data

The data-set was acquired from a research that focused on predicting the probability of default payments among customers in Taiwan using six data mining methods. Since the actual probability of default was unknown, the research introduced a new method called the “Sorting Smoothing Method” to estimate the real probability of default.

The study then used the estimated probability of default as the response variable and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable to develop a simple linear regression model. The results indicate that the artificial neural network method has the highest coefficient of determination, with a regression intercept close to zero and a regression coefficient close to one. As a result, among the six data mining techniques compared, the artificial neural network method is the only one that can accurately estimate the real probability of default.
