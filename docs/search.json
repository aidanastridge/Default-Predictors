    "text": "About the Data\nThe data set was acquired from a research that focused on predicting the probability of default payments among customers in Taiwan using six data mining methods. Since the actual probability of default was unknown, the research introduced a new method called the “Sorting Smoothing Method” to estimate probability of default.\nThey then used the estimated probability as the response variable and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable in a simple linear regression. What they found was that an artificial neural network method had the highest coefficient of determination, with a regression intercept close to zero and a regression coefficient close to one. As a result, the artificial neural network method is the one they chose.\n(Yeh and Lien 2009)\n\nThe data-set originally had 30,000 values; 70% of the data was taken out by filtering out below 5% and above 95% from a majority of the continuous variables. However, I’ve elected to keep the payment delays per month as it takes out to many variables\n\n\nCategories\n\n\n\nDefault next month by Percent\n\n\nDefault\n14.72\n\n\nDid not default\n85.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarital Status by Percent\n\n\nMarried\n45.43\n\n\nSingle\n53.29\n\n\nOthers\n1.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighest Educational Level by Percent\n\n\nGraduate\n31.82\n\n\nUniversity\n50.84\n\n\nHigh School\n15.87\n\n\nOthers\n1.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex by Percent\n\n\nMale\n38.27\n\n\nFemale\n61.73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Values\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance\nAge\n\n\n\n\n\nMin. : 30000\nMin. :24.0\n\n\n\n1st Qu.: 70000\n1st Qu.:28.0\n\n\n\nMedian :130000\nMedian :34.0\n\n\n\nMean :148987\nMean :34.7\n\n\n\n3rd Qu.:210000\n3rd Qu.:40.0\n\n\n\nMax. :420000\nMax. :52.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 2005 — September 2005 in Payments and Bills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2005-04-01 Payment\n2005-05-01 Payment\n2005-06-01 Payment\n2005-07-01 Payment\n2005-08-01 Payment\n2005-09-01 Payment\n2005-04-01 Bill\n2005-05-01 Bill\n2005-06-01 Bill\n2005-07-01 Bill\n2005-08-01 Bill\n2005-09-01 Bill\n\n\n\n\n\nMin. : 1\nMin. : 1\nMin. : 1\nMin. : 1\nMin. : 1\nMin. : 1\nMin. : 22\nMin. : 4\nMin. : 68\nMin. : 26\nMin. : 49\nMin. : 73\n\n\n\n1st Qu.: 1000\n1st Qu.: 1004\n1st Qu.: 1000\n1st Qu.: 1336\n1st Qu.: 1699\n1st Qu.: 1800\n1st Qu.: 9481\n1st Qu.: 10170\n1st Qu.: 11724\n1st Qu.: 13055\n1st Qu.: 13730\n1st Qu.: 14622\n\n\n\nMedian : 2000\nMedian : 2000\nMedian : 2000\nMedian : 2200\nMedian : 2655\nMedian : 2979\nMedian : 28774\nMedian : 29292\nMedian : 33498\nMedian : 41424\nMedian : 45199\nMedian : 47113\n\n\n\nMean : 2884\nMean : 2830\nMean : 2783\nMean : 3048\nMean : 3422\nMean : 3546\nMean : 40958\nMean : 42168\nMean : 45406\nMean : 49894\nMean : 52943\nMean : 55340\n\n\n\n3rd Qu.: 4000\n3rd Qu.: 3922\n3rd Qu.: 3782\n3rd Qu.: 4000\n3rd Qu.: 4584\n3rd Qu.: 4872\n3rd Qu.: 62012\n3rd Qu.: 65020\n3rd Qu.: 69496\n3rd Qu.: 76127\n3rd Qu.: 80400\n3rd Qu.: 83850\n\n\n\nMax. :17120\nMax. :15868\nMax. :16014\nMax. :17475\nMax. :19000\nMax. :18400\nMax. :161902\nMax. :164717\nMax. :173455\nMax. :184900\nMax. :194699\nMax. :200996\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nExpected Value\n\n\n\n\nDefault Status\nDid not default\n\n\nAge\n34\n\n\nSex\nFemale\n\n\nEducation\nUniversity\n\n\nMarital Status\nSingle\n\n\nBalance\n147,357\n\n\nGrowth in Payment (April - September)\n18%\n\n\nGrowth in Bill (April - September)\n27%\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment Delays\n\n\n\nApril 2005 Payment Delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay duly\n2 month delay\n3 month delay\n4 month delay\n5 month delay\n6 month delay\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n1099\n139\n2\n1\n0\n1\n\n\nDid not default\n7088\n104\n1\n2\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 2005 Payment Delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay duly\n2 month delay\n3 month delay\n4 month delay\n5 month delay\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n1103\n136\n0\n2\n1\n\n\nDid not default\n7106\n87\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 2005 Payment Delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay duly\n2 month delay\n3 month delay\n4 month delay\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n1091\n148\n1\n2\n\n\nDid not default\n7070\n122\n3\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2005 Payment Delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay duly\n1 month delay\n2 month delay\n3 month delay\n4 month delay\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n1061\n0\n176\n3\n2\n\n\nDid not default\n7029\n1\n163\n2\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust 2005 Payment Delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay duly\n1 month delay\n2 month delay\n3 month delay\n4 month delay\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n1051\n0\n177\n13\n1\n\n\nDid not default\n7042\n1\n149\n4\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 2005 Payment Delays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay duly\n1 month delay\n2 month delay\n3 month delay\n4 month delay\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n827\n34\n362\n17\n2\n\n\nDid not default\n6931\n114\n144\n7\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefaults by Category"
